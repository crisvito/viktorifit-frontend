## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli)

```bash
# Install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RachmaH4/ViktorifitFrontend.git

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd ViktorifitFrontend

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install
```

---

## Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

---

## Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
ng generate service service-name
ng generate module module-name
ng generate directive directive-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

---

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

---

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

### End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
